Code review tool

I wanted to build some nice UI with some statistics about objects. 

For example: - I want to see dependencies between types in my project - I want to see number of statements in specific type of object - I want to see type of object etc.

For sake of simplicity Iâ€™m interested in 3 scala object types: class, object, trait.
